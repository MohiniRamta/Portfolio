            <p>I'm currently a Communication and Multimediadesign (CMD) student at the Amsterdam Univeristy of Applied Sciences. 
                I always have had a passion for art and creative work, but i am also very technical. I wanted to find a course that will help me grow in both aspects. 
                I started learning HTML/CSS at school, and I made a lot of progress in my journey as a designer and Developer.  </p>
            <p>I want to learn to be part of a team in a company </p>
